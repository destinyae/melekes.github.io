  <h1>One month in Japan</h1>
  <time datetime=2019-10-21T10:54:29-0500 class="post-date">Mon, Oct 21, 2019</time>
  <p>After being in this country for almost one month, here are three things that
shocked me the most:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Respect by default</strong>. People here respect each other even if they don&rsquo;t
know the person. The signs - bowing, giving something with two hands instead
of one, being silent in public transport, etc.</li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="https://homeonrails.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/2019-10-21-japan/2019-05-19&#43;18.36.45.jpg"/>
</figure>

<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Attention to details</strong>. This ranges from food packing (with a separate box
for each ingredient) to architecture. E.g. when I visited teamLab planets in
Tokyo, I found out that the exit is located right near the enter. It’s
super convenient since you already know where your locker &amp; toilets are.</li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="https://homeonrails.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/2019-10-21-japan/2019-05-13&#43;19.43.49.jpg"/>
</figure>

<ol start="3">
<li><strong>How clean it is</strong>. Honestly I think now every city should remove garbage
cans from its streets. But what should I do with the garbage? You bring it
with you and sort it at home. Easier than you think. But requires laws &amp;
community efforts.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cities">Cities</h3>
<p>Tokyo is cool. You can find almost anything you want. My top 3 places: teamLab
planets, Akihabara and Edo museum. Wanted to go watch sumo, but all the tickets
were sold out. Same for Ghibli Museum.</p>
<figure><img src="https://homeonrails.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/2019-10-21-japan/2019-05-14&#43;20.15.55.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>Hakone is a great place to relax with its hot springs and hiking trails.
Another thing I love is that you can stumble upon a tea house which has been
open for a few centuries and enjoy a cup of amazake or a tea.</p>
<figure><img src="https://homeonrails.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/2019-10-21-japan/2019-05-18&#43;13.59.26.jpg"/>

<p>Kyoto has a nice old town and temples, but felt too touristy to me. Geisha(s)
dance at Pontocho Kaburenjo is a must thing to watch. Higashiyama Jisho-ji is
the most beautiful garden I&rsquo;ve been to in Japan (I was in Kenrokuen - bigger,
but not as impressive).</p>
<p><figure><img src="https://homeonrails.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/2019-10-21-japan/2019-05-22&#43;15.20.30.jpg"/>

</figure>
</p>
<p>Nara is famous for deers roaming in the city park. A lot of the cities nowadays
become too distant from nature (though some are trying to bring it back by
opening more parks, etc.). One of the biggest downsides - the smell.</p>
<figure><img src="https://homeonrails.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/2019-10-21-japan/2019-05-23&#43;18.14.56.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>Hiroshima is where I&rsquo;d choose to live in Japan. Not too big, yet there&rsquo;s a lot
going on - festivals &amp; different other activities. Close to Miyajima, where I&rsquo;d
go when I want to be alone.</p>
<figure><img src="https://homeonrails.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/2019-10-21-japan/2019-05-26&#43;13.13.09.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>Miyajima is a village located on the small island of Itsukushima, where shops &amp;
restaurants close at 5pm. Good hiking trails. Very calm and peaceful place
(pierce is crowded during a day though).</p>
<figure><img src="https://homeonrails.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/2019-10-21-japan/2019-05-26&#43;17.17.29.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>Shirakawa-go village is famous for its traditional gassho-zukuri farmhouses,
some of which are more than 250 years old.</p>
<figure><img src="https://homeonrails.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/2019-10-21-japan/2019-05-31&#43;14.11.36.jpg"/>

<h3 id="about-japanese-people">About Japanese people</h3>
<p>I want to tell you one story. It happened to me when I was traveling from
Toyama to Takayama. I boarded a train, got into my seat and prepared myself
for a nice ride. If you ever go to these places, take the same train I did
bound to Nagoya (or a bus). Mountains, immersed in the greenery, the Jinzu
river with colors ranging from deep blue to light green and beautiful small
villages will be accompanying you during the whole trip.</p>
<p>But back to the story. I was reading a book when someone touched my shoulder.
It was an older woman wearing a white cotton sweater and blue jeans. She was
smiling at me. She said I need to change my seat. She clearly did not work
there. Nonetheless, I checked my ticket and saw that the car number was
different (8 while I was in the 10th). But how did she know? So I stood up and
went to the 8th car. In the process, she again has stopped me and tried to
explain something. I replied that I got my car wrong. Got into the correct car
now. I found my seat.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the same woman touched my shoulder. This time she brought
a text note with her. The note was saying she only wanted to suggest I&rsquo;d move
closer to the window as not so many people reserve a green car (read first
class) and that she&rsquo;s sorry. She gave me a couple of small chocolate bars. It
may be hard for you to understand Japan and it&rsquo;s people just from this story,
but I think it nicely shows the deep respect coupled with a desire to help.</p>
<p>Deep respect was one of the things that have shocked me. &ldquo;Why should I respect
someone whom I don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; I asked Hiroyuki. &ldquo;Because everyone feels good if
you do this&rdquo; he responded. I could not agree more. Before I did not understand
why Americans smile at each other even if they might be in a bad mood. The
answer seems to be the same. It feels good!</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A few minuses:</p>
<ul>
<li>everything is super expensive</li>
<li>mostly sea food (I don&rsquo;t eat fish)</li>
</ul>
<p>A few pluses:</p>
<ul>
<li>good food almost everywhere (even in supermarkets)</li>
<li>super safe</li>
<li>easy to travel (especially with a JR pass)</li>
<li>a lot of places to visit</li>
<li>rich culture and history</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d definitely recommend to visit because it&rsquo;s such a unique country.</p>
