<p>Read 55 books this year. The shortest book was &ldquo;If You Can&rdquo; by William J.
Bernstein, the longest - &ldquo;The Snowball&rdquo; by Alice Schroeder. Reread the all time
great &ldquo;Dune&rdquo; by Frank Herbert and two Yuval Noah Harari books. There were three
photography books: &ldquo;Wall and Piece&rdquo; by Banksy, &ldquo;Ara Güler&rsquo;s Istanbul&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Icons of Men&rsquo;s Style&rdquo; by Josh Sims.</p>
<p>Here are my top 5 favorite books of 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133922-educated">Educated by Tara Westover</a></p>
<p>The book reminded me of Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood
by Trevor Noah, which takes you on a journey to South Africa at the time of
apartheid. This book does the same, but opens another window, through which
you can see the live of a mormon family (although very radical one).
I&rsquo;d recommend the audio version.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/94318.Awareness">Awareness: A de Mello Spirituality Conference in His Own Words by Anthony de Mello</a></p>
<p>I guess this book really stands out for its contrary point of view. I had
quite a few AHA moments while reading it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the more personally challenging books I&rsquo;ve ever read. It
made me think&hellip; hard. I wanted to sit down and argue with this guy. I didn&rsquo;t
like how it was written. I didn&rsquo;t like what he said about people and
selfishness and being and love, but I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it. The more
time passes, the more I think thiss asshole is on to something. The Pope must
have thoght so too, since he EXCOMMUNICATED HIM FOR WRITING IT.

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51250.Wall_and_Piece">Wall and Piece by Banksy</a></p>
<p>For all the Banksy fans out there. Loved the photos and the small text intro
telling his position on advertisement and governments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work">Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport</a></p>
<p>Living in the era of the information abundance, it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly
hard to focus. I too feel it. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t even notice the moment you
go to Twitter/Facebook/Instagram/etc. But in most areas, you do need to focus
on a job at hand (unless your job is multitasking). This book explains both
why and how to archive deep focus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26156469-never-split-the-difference">Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It by Chris Voss</a></p>
<p>A handful of techniques from a past FBI international lead hostage negotiator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
