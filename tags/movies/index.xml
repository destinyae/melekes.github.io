      <description>On my way from Berlin to Warsaw I&amp;rsquo;ve met 2 really cool guys from India - Winny and Raghav. They asked me to recommend 3 Russian movies to them and I did. Then I asked to return a favor. I watched all of them and they are amazing. No wonder they all have a very good score on IMDB. So, thank you guys!
