      <description>In the light of the recent news, I wanted to share an idea I had just recently.
Every popular open-source project on Github eventually becomes overwhelmed by the number of issues. That&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to create one. You are not required to understand the project. You are not required to read the documentation. All you need is a Github account.
And this is an example of the amplification attack.</description>
