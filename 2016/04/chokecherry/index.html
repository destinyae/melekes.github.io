  <h1>Chokecherry Or The Story About 1000000 Timeouts</h1>
  <time datetime=2016-04-24T11:25:45Z class="post-date">Sun, Apr 24, 2016</time>
  <p>Chokecherry (<a href="https://github.com/funbox/chokecherry">https://github.com/funbox/chokecherry</a>) is a wrapper around lager
logger which limits the volume of info messages irrespectively of the lager&rsquo;s
backend.</p>
<p>This article tells a story behind this library. Down below you&rsquo;ll find answers to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Why it was created?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;How it works?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do I need it?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-story-about-1000000-timeouts">The Story About 1000000 Timeouts</h2>
<p>We use lager in almost all of our applications. And it works pretty well most
of the time, except the cases where it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.homeonrails.com/images/posts/2016-04-24-chokecherry/karate.gif"/>
</figure>

<p>It all started one day when we were experiencing a <strong>peak load</strong> in one of the
applications (we&rsquo;ll call it FortKnox). So, FortKnox was processing a lot of
data and producing a lot of logs (particularly, info messages). As
shown on a picture below, we were writing logs to a file on disk.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.homeonrails.com/images/posts/2016-04-24-chokecherry/app1.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Then we started seeing <strong>random exits</strong> (timeouts in calls to <code>lager:info</code>)
from many places. These led to different parts (gen_servers, gen_fsms, etc.) of
FortKnox crashing. Some of them got restarted by their supervisor. But it was
clear that this won&rsquo;t last long. Indeed, at some point, it all came down to the
application&rsquo;s supervisor and <strong>whole node stopped working</strong>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.homeonrails.com/images/posts/2016-04-24-chokecherry/app2.png"/>
</figure>

<p>This is what happened. <strong>Hard disk was not able to handle so much writes</strong> (even in
the presence of OS caches). <a href="https://github.com/basho/lager/blob/ec43800bd5bf0286c5d591fbda0b2d22fccf4d7b/src/lager_file_backend.erl#L257">file:write</a> became slower and lager&rsquo;s
message box started to grow in size. The behavior for lager, in that case, is
to switch to synchronous mode (see
<a href="https://github.com/basho/lager#overload-protection">https://github.com/basho/lager#overload-protection</a> for details), what he did.
That&rsquo;s how we came to the random exits.</p>
<p>Possible solutions were (<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/erlang-russian/8xEeffAV8sc">discussion on erlang-russian</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><del>RAM disk</del> (high cost of maintenance)</li>
<li><del>configure lager in such a way, that would fix the problem</del> (no way to do that)</li>
<li><del>use tmpfs for <code>/tmp</code></del> (low cost of maintenance; difficult to setup syncing tmpfs to disk; some logs still could be lost)</li>
<li>create a thin wrapper around lager (low cost of maintenance; easy to setup; some logs may be dropped)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="on-lager-settings">On lager settings</h3>
<p>lager has many settings and we could play with them. For example, we could turn
off synchronous mode.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.homeonrails.com/images/posts/2016-04-24-chokecherry/app3.png"/>
</figure>

<p>What will happen then is lager&rsquo;s mailbox start growing and, eventually, when
there will be no more free memory, node will crash.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For performance, the file backend does delayed writes, although it will sync
at specific log levels, configured via the `sync_on&rsquo; option. By default the
error level or above will trigger a sync.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that there were an exessive amount of info messages, so no <code>fsync</code>
calls (<a href="https://github.com/basho/lager/blob/1159f9262fb589ce2ec310eb7dec5ac03b1fee16/src/lager_file_backend.erl#L262">file:datasync</a>) were made (we didn&rsquo;t change the default).</p>
<p>So <strong>there was no simple solution</strong> for this problem. <strong>That&rsquo;s why we created
chokecherry</strong>. What follows is how it works.</p>
<h2 id="chokecherry">Chokecherry</h2>
<figure><img src="https://www.homeonrails.com/images/posts/2016-04-24-chokecherry/app4.png"/>
</figure>

<p><strong>shaper</strong> accumulates incoming messages in the queue. If the queue size
exceeds <code>log_queue_capacity</code> within a certain time period (1 second), it sends
an error_report &ldquo;chokecherry dropped N messages in the last second&rdquo;, and drops
messages from the end of the queue, while receiving new ones and maintaining
the maximum size of the queue.</p>
<p><strong>writer</strong> pulls messages from <strong>shaper</strong> and transmits them to lager.</p>
<p>Default settings are as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[
    {chokecherry, [
        {shaper, [
            {timeout, 1000},
            {log_queue_capacity, 10000}
        ]}
    ]}
].
</code></pre><h2 id="do-you-need-it">Do you need it</h2>
<p>If your application produces a lot of logs and you can afford to lose some
(i.e. stable work of an application is more important to you) - <strong>yes</strong>.</p>
<p>In the above story, we were writing logs to a file using <code>lager_file_backend</code>.
This doesn&rsquo;t mean that a similar story could not happen to you if you&rsquo;re using
a different backend. So it may be applicable to other backends likewise.</p>
<h2 id="source-code">Source code</h2>
<p>Currently, we are only &ldquo;shaping&rdquo; info messages. If you think we should do it
for warning and error, or make it optional, let us know.</p>
