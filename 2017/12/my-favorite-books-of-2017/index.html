<p>This year I’ve set a very ambitious goal for me, which is to read fifty books.
And I almost did it. Never thought it would be possible to even read forty
books. The key here, as many of you know, is to find one hour in evening or
before you go to sleep (depending on what works best for you) and spend it
reading. Audiobooks are great too!</p>
<p>If you are looking for something to spend a few good evenings, I highly
recommend these 5 books:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1342380.Naufrag_Volontaire">Naufragé Volontaire by Alain
Bombard</a>. Alain
Bombar - one of the strongest man I’ve read about. The story itself is
fascinating. Also, the book carries a practical purpose, giving all sorts of
hints for survival in open water (for example, can you drink sea water? how
much? how often?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15815364-how-to-get-filthy-rich-in-rising-asia">How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia by Mohsin
Hamid</a>.
At first, I thought that the book is a step by step guide, haha. When in fact,
it tells the life of a poor boy who dreams of someday becoming rich. His way to
the top with victories and loses. His mistakes and lessons he had learned. I
would definitely watch a movie when there will be such. When you’re reading it,
you feel like you standing right there, next to the main character. This
happens so rarely! Wow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222146.Masters_of_Doom">Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture by
David Kushner, Wil
Wheaton</a>. Another
very captivating story, which immerses you into the plot almost immediately
like any game, created by its heroes. Can&rsquo;t recommend this book more to
<em>entrepreneurs or gamers</em>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27036528-ego-is-the-enemy">Ego Is the Enemy by Ryan
Holiday</a>. I
would recommend this book to any person in his/her 20s. It’s a mix of stoic
philosophy, history and Ryan’s observations focusing on the role of ego. “Many
of us insist the main impediment to a full, successful life is the outside
world. In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our
careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it
can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies
each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us
back.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10016013-harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by Eliezer
Yudkowsky</a>.
It&rsquo;s everything you dream about while watching &ldquo;Lord of the rings” or any other
popular movie nowadays. You most probably do a facepalm every minute or so,
when a hero performs another “stupid” (irrational) move. The plot is almost the
same as the original Harry Potter except now young Harry act completely
rationally. This book is incredibly funny and you can learn a lot. Awesome!</p>
</li>
</ul>
